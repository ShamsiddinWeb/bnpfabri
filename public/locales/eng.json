The presence of Almighty God, who has formed us in his image, and that universal breath of love that sustains us, floats around us in eternal bliss; Then, my friend, when darkness covers my eyes, heaven and earth are in my heart. and as if absorbing its power into the image of its beloved mistress, I often think longingly, Oh, could I describe these concepts?
